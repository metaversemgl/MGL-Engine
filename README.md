# MGL-Engine
as we said in Metaverse MGL WhitePaper :
Genesis introduces the MGL-Engine standard, which is a complete set of development tools for anyone working with real-time technology. This gives all the inhabitants of the lands of Genesis the freedom to have all their imagination without any restrictions in the world of Genesis.
This is a start for the Metaverse MGL network and its Genesis Land.
Today we have decided to tell you a little about the features that this standard gives you along with its tools.
1- The first and most important issue is that this tool is provided completely free of charge to the inhabitants of Genesis, (not only the owners; but all the inhabitants) all the inhabitants of the land of Genesis can use the tools of Barachiel; That's why we named this tool Barachiel, which works like an angel with you for your success.
2. When it comes to VR, real-time technology should not be ignored.
Barachiel does all the necessary materials in an instant without the need for rendering time on your Genesis Land;
In this case, no separate time is wasted for calculating the construction of your land and your objects.
Barachiel's processing capabilities, as well as its ability to present in VR in an extremely short period of time compared to similar tools, as well as its VR presentation, help you make your Genesis land look like a real reality.

5.
